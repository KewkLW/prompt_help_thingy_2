Here is a README.md file I created to document the Streamlit append script application:

# Streamlit Append Script

This is a simple Streamlit app to generate text by appending prefix, main text, additional text and suffix together.

## What it does

This app allows you to:

- Enter prefix, main text, additional text and suffix (each as multiline text)
- Specify an output directory 
- Generate a text file that appends all the entered texts together

## Requirements 
```
pip install Streamlit
```

## Usage

To use this app:

1. Run `streamlit run app.py` to start the app
2. Enter prefix, main text, additional text and suffix in the respective text areas
3. Specify the output directory path
4. Click on "Generate Text"
5. The output text file will be generated in the output directory as `output.txt`

The output file contains all combinations of prefix + main text + additional text + suffix, appending them together with spaces and writing each combination in a new line.

Here is an explanation I would add to the README for an average user to understand how multiline inputs work:

## Multiline Input

This application allows you to enter prefix, main text, additional text and suffix over multiple lines like:

```
First line of prefix
Second line of prefix
```

When you use multiline inputs, here is what happens:

- Each separate line you enter is treated as a distinct piece of text
- The application joins the multiline text into different combinations 
    - Line 1 of main text + Line 1 of additional text 
    - Line 1 of main text + Line 2 of additional text
- So each line you enter exponentially increases the number of text combinations that are created!

This allows you to enter variations over multiple lines and quickly generate all combinations.

For example, if you enter:

```
Prefix Line 1 

Main text A
Main text B 

Additional 1

Suffix 1
Suffix 2
Suffix 3
Suffix 4
```

The output will contain:

```
Prefix Line 1  Main text A Additional 1 Suffix 1
Prefix Line 1  Main text A Additional 1 Suffix 2 
Prefix Line 1  Main text A Additional 1 Suffix 3
Prefix Line 1  Main text A Additional 1 Suffix 4

Prefix Line 1  Main text B  Additional 1 Suffix 1
Prefix Line 1  Main text B  Additional 1 Suffix 2 
Prefix Line 1  Main text B  Additional 1 Suffix 3
Prefix Line 1  Main text B  Additional 1 Suffix 4
```
